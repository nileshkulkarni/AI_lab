Kalman Filters for Robot Localization:
 

 -- What is roboto Localization & why?
 -- Problems in real world, ana available info?
 -- Some existing methods Probabilistic Frameworks to solve localization issues:
        Terms:
            ProsteriroBelief & PriorBelief
        Methods:
        -- grid based approaches
        -- Particle Filters

 -- Kalman Filters:
        -- Why do they work?Intutive Idea based on increment in information & decrease in variance of the Gaussian
        -- assumptions in the framework
        -- State Estimation
        -- Gaussian ProsteriorBelief & Gaussian PriorBelief
        -- Linear Kalman Filter
