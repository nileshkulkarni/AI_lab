Kalman Filters for Robot Localization:
 

 -- What is robot Localization & why?
 -- Problems in real world, and available info?
 -- Some existing methods, Probabilistic Frameworks to solve localization issues:
        Terms:
            ProsterirBelief & PriorBelief
        Methods:
        -- grid based approaches
        -- Particle Filters

 -- Kalman Filters:
        -- Why do they work?Intutive Idea based on increment in information & decrease in variance of the Gaussian
        -- assumptions in the framework
        -- State Estimation
        -- Gaussian ProsteriorBelief & Gaussian PriorBelief
        -- Linear Kalman Filter
        
 -- Extended Kalman Filters:
        -- Berif Overview, applications
